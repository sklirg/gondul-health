Gondul health in HTML (or JS in browser)
========================================

Note: Run the example example webserver from the root of this project for the href to work correctly, as you cannot `..` outside of the root path of a web server.

Import the ES module and use it as any other imported piece of code.

By importing the code following the ESM spec you can use the imported code just as any code local to the JS file, nothing special about it.
